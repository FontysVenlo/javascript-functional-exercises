In these folders are multiple files, e.g. [training01.js](ex_01/training01.js).

Follow the instructions in these files (instructions are written in the comments) and run these files to practice!

## To run a file

To run a file, preferably do it in your Visual Studio integrated Terminal (Menu: View -> Terminal):

```javascript
npx babel-node ex_01/training01.js
```

![npx run](resources/npx-run.gif)

You can do this to run all the other exercises as well.

If you are finished with the exercises, start with the assignments.
